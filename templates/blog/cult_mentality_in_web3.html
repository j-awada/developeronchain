        <p>Maybe it's just me, but I don't like labels. It is ironic given that I "belong" to the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

        <p>I guess labels can be useful to identify with a group. I don't have anything against people wanting to use labels. But I did recently see an interesting case of hypocrisy.</p>

        <p>Personally, as a developer, the 2 blockchains I'm interested in are Bitcoin and Solana.</p>

        <p>I went to a Bitcoin meetup where the keynote speaker had an art background and was sharing his wisdom on stage.</p>

        <p>In this article, I don't want to only criticize, so I will say, he is a talented artist.</p>

        <p>What I found notably contradicting is that his talk was centered around criticizing the "woke" culture in the US/Canada. How "woke" people belong to a free-speech cancelling cult. He shared his disappointement with the newwave comics that are being ruined by the introduction of characters such as women and lesbians.</p>

        <p>He was clearly unhappy about the state of affairs.</p>

        <p>But at the same time, he belonged to the cult of Bitcoin. Proudly mocking "shit coins". Pledging allegiance to the one and only BTC.</p>

        <p>Yes, bitcoin maximalists are hypocryts. They are mad at the world for hindering free speech (and money) while at the same time being firmly against any use of other crypto coins.</p>

        <p>I'm not saying you have to love other blockchains, but at least spend your keynote speech talking about bitcoin rather than shitting on everyone else who is not a bitcoin maximalist.</p>

        <p><mark>I have a general rule: If I am attending something like a talk where I start having negative emotions provoked by the speaker like anger, hate, etc then I'm in the wrong place and I need to leave.</mark></p>

        <p>I went to that bitcoin meetup wanting to learn more about the chain, meet techie people and joyously discuss ideas.. But instead I got the same kind of "woke" rhetoric except from the far right.</p>

        <p>As <a class="text-link" href="https://paulgraham.com/identity.html" target="_blank">Paul Graham's article title</a> accurately says, keep your identity small.</p>
